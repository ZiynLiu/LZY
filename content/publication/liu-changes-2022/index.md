abstract: Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has attracted
  extensive attention due to its adverse impacts on public health. Although PM2.5
  pollution was significantly reduced in China over time, while little is known how
  the spatial disparity of PM2.5 exposure has evolved, especially from both absolute
  and relative perspectives. Here, we estimate the long-term PM2.5 exposures in China
  based on satellite observations and convolutional neural network, and characterize
  the spatial disparity of PM2.5 exposure using Theil index and rank-rank relationship.
  The result shows that both PM2.5 exposure and absolute spatial disparity were substantially
  reduced between 2010 and 2019. The nation-wide concentrations (Theil index) declined
  from 48.0μg/m3 (0.13) to 35.5μg/m3 (0.054). The interprovincial disparities dominate
  the overall disparity in 2010, while the intra-provincial disparity contributed
  the most in 2019. However, while absolute disparities have diminished, relative
  disparities persist. PM2.5 exposures in the least 20th percentile polluted cities
  have increased over time, while exposures in other regions declined. On average,
  the more (less) polluted cities in 2010 were still the more (less) polluted cities
  in 2019 (except for the very most 2 percentile polluted cities), indicating that
  the population in more polluted cities still experiences more air pollution than
  others. Spatial pattern of relative disparity changes was also observed. Overall,
  understanding not only absolute spatial disparity but also relative disparity is
  required to help formulate targeted policies for an equitable environment, leaving
  nobody behind.
