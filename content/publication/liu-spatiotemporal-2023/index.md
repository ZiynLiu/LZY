abstract: High carbon emissions (CE) have unbalanced the carbon cycle patterns on
  Earth, resulting in global warming and extreme weather events. However, the disparity
  and inequalities of carbon emissions have barely been explored from environmental
  justice perspective, which can help to formulate a more equitable carbon policy.
  Therefore, the satellite-based ODIAC dataset was adopted to first analyze the spatiotemporal
  characteristics of CE in China between 2010 and 2019; then the spatial disparities
  and environmental inequalities of CE were explored during the study period. The
  results show that CE in China increased by 13.74% during 2010-2019, with decadal
  mean of 91.49 million tons. The hotspots were observed in the eastern coastal and
  the northeastern regions. The spatial disparity decreased over the decade, with
  Theil index declining from 0.186 in 2010 to 0.163 in 2019. The inequality result
  indicates CE disproportionately affected populations living in low GDP per capita
  regions, while it became more equally distributed over time. The results suggest
  that the spatial and environmental inequality of CE need to be considered in policy
  formulation for a more equitable environment.
