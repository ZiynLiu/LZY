 abstract = {High carbon emissions (CE) have unbalanced the carbon cycle patterns on Earth, resulting in global warming and extreme weather events. However, the disparity and inequalities of carbon emissions have barely been explored from environmental justice perspective, which can help to formulate a more equitable carbon policy. Therefore, the satellite-based ODIAC dataset was adopted to first analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of CE in China between 2010 and 2019; then the spatial disparities and environmental inequalities of CE were explored during the study period. The results show that CE in China increased by 13.74% during 2010-2019, with decadal mean of 91.49 million tons. The hotspots were observed in the eastern coastal and the northeastern regions. The spatial disparity decreased over the decade, with Theil index declining from 0.186 in 2010 to 0.163 in 2019. The inequality result indicates CE disproportionately affected populations living in low GDP per capita regions, while it became more equally distributed over time. The results suggest that the spatial and environmental inequality of CE need to be considered in policy formulation for a more equitable environment.},
